# ColonoscopyDetection
The Health Analytics department from a very well-known hospital located in a European country has started a project to improve the results of the diagnosis related to colonoscopies. The project consists of highlighting certain areas of video frames of a colonoscopy that might be considered more relevant for colorectal illnesses due to the texture of the image in them. WIth this project we are trying to predict relevance of each image to the desease identification.
